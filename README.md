## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- A Supabase account and project
- OpenAI API key for policy extraction

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd ai-policy-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Run the SQL schema from `database/schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   # Supabase Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
   
   # OpenAI Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   
   # Optional: For automated collection (production)
   CRON_SECRET=your-cron-secret
   ADMIN_KEY=your-admin-key
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Initial Policy Collection**
   Run a historical backfill to populate your database:
   ```bash
   # 30-day backfill
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/collect-policies?days_back=30"
   
   # Or 1-year backfill for comprehensive data
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/collect-policies?days_back=365"
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

### Automated Policy Collection

The system automatically collects AI policies from government sources:

1. **Manual Collection**: Click "Collect Now" in the dashboard for immediate updates
2. **API Collection**: Use the API endpoint for custom timeframes:
   ```bash
   # Daily update (7 days)
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/collect-policies"
   
   # Custom timeframe
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/collect-policies?days_back=30"
   ```
3. **Automated Cron**: Set up automated daily collection in production

### Dashboard Features

- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status, risk levels, and confidence scores
- **Smart Formatting**: JSON data automatically formatted as lists or paragraphs
- **Source Links**: Direct links to original government documents
- **Statistics**: Real-time collection status and policy counts

### Policy Status Options
